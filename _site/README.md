# Tableau Workshop
### Updated Feburary 2017
This lesson will take you through creating a data visualization with Tableau.

Tableau is a drag and drop tool that allows users to create visualizations without any programming. Tableau Public is available for anyone for free, but you have to save your visualizations to the Tableau server. If you have data you cannot or do not want to make public, [academic trials of the full software are available](https://www.tableau.com/academic).

## Getting the Data
We are going to be mapping Crime Data in the US from 1960 to 2014. This data comes from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics. The table was created using the [UCR Data Tool](https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/) using the State by state and national estimates options. Like most real world data this data is not perfect.

We also performed minor clean up for this data to be more easily useable.
